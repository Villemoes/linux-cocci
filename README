These are some coccinelle scripts which may be useful on the linux
kernel. For the most part, I haven't tried to get them into the kernel
tree, for various reasons. Some were just used to find and fix a
certain issue which is unlikely to appear again. Others produce too
many false positives, while yet others deal with things which is
likely not worth the churn to fix (such as pointing out missing
va_end()).

printf_abuse: This directory contains semantic patches for replacing
certain printf calls by simpler equivalents. For example,
'sprintf(buf, "%s", s);' can always be replaced by 'strcpy(buf,
s);'. However, if the return value of sprintf is used, one has to be a
bit more careful.

devnull: This is where .cocci files go when they've served their purpose.

misc: Stuff I haven't categorized yet.

microopt: Various micro-optimizations that make the generated code
smaller and/or faster.

wtf: This directory is for scripts detecting stuff such as double
inequalities that don't work in C as they do in Python and
mathematics.
